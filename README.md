# Grabbit

**English** · [Italiano](README.it.md)

Download **video** and **music** from YouTube and Spotify with a simple interface.
Written in Rust (lightweight: the AppImage is about 4 MB), it relies on
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and runs on Windows, Linux and macOS.
The interface is in Italian if your system language is Italian, and in English otherwise.

## What it does

- **Video**: MP4 / MKV / WebM, maximum quality of your choice (up to 4K).
- **Audio**: MP3, M4A (AAC), Opus, OGG Vorbis, FLAC, WAV, with a **bitrate** choice.
- Choose the destination folder; paste several links at once (one per line).
- **Playlists**: files go into a folder named after the playlist and are called
  `1 - Title.mp4`, `2 - Title.mp4`… (the playlist name is not part of the file name).
- Cover art and metadata embedded in the files.
- Queue with live progress and a **Cancel** button.
- **Sets itself up**: on first launch it downloads yt-dlp, ffmpeg and Deno
  (the JavaScript runtime yt-dlp needs for YouTube); on every launch it checks
  whether a newer yt-dlp exists and updates it.
- **Updates itself**: on every launch, right away (without waiting for the rest), it looks at the
  latest GitHub release and, if it is newer, downloads it, replaces the app and restarts it.
  A line at the bottom of the window always tells you how the check went.
  On Linux it works from the AppImage; it can be turned off in the advanced options.

### How Spotify works

Spotify encrypts its audio (DRM) and yt-dlp cannot download it. Grabbit only reads the
**public data** of the link (title and artist of a track, album or playlist), then
**searches for the same track on YouTube** and downloads the audio from there. So:

- the result is the audio of the YouTube version, not the original Spotify file;
- a playlist can show at most about 100 tracks;
- if Spotify changes the structure of its public pages, reading links may stop
  working until Grabbit is updated.

> Use Grabbit only for content you have the right to download and in compliance with

## Installation

| System | File from the *Releases* page | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | `grabbit-windows-x86_64.exe` | double-click; SmartScreen may warn because the executable is not signed |
| Linux | `grabbit-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | `chmod +x` and double-click (auto-update only works from the AppImage) |
| macOS | `Grabbit-macos-aarch64.app.zip` (Apple Silicon) or `…-x86_64.app.zip` (Intel) | unzip, drag into *Applications*; the first time right-click → Open (the app is not notarized). If macOS calls it "damaged": `xattr -cr /Applications/Grabbit.app` |

Data and downloaded tools are stored in:
Windows `%APPDATA%\Grabbit\Grabbit\data`, Linux `~/.local/share/grabbit`,
macOS `~/Library/Application Support/org.Grabbit.Grabbit`.

## Creating a release

The Windows, Linux and macOS versions are built **on GitHub**, automatically
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Nothing needs to be installed on your PC.

### Preparation (once)

1. Create a repository on GitHub and upload the project (including the `.github` folder).
2. You do not need to edit `Cargo.toml`: the versions built by GitHub look for
   updates in the very repository they were built from. (Only if you build locally,
   set `repository` in `Cargo.toml` to your GitHub address.)
3. On GitHub: *Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions* and choose
   **Read and write permissions** (needed to create tags and releases).

### Every time you want to publish a version

1. On GitHub open the **Actions** tab → **Release** on the left → **Run workflow**.
2. In the *New version* field type the number, for example `0.2.0`, and confirm.
3. Wait 10-20 minutes. The workflow, by itself:
   - updates the version in `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` and creates the tag `v0.2.0`;
   - builds Windows, Linux and macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon);
   - publishes the release on the **Releases** page with all the files.
4. Apps that are already installed find the new release on their next launch and update.

Numbers follow the `major.minor.patch` format: `0.1.0` → `0.1.1` for a fix,
`0.2.0` for a new feature, `1.0.0` for the first stable version.
A version that has already been used cannot be published again: pick a higher one.

**Alternatives**

- *From a terminal*: raise `version` in `Cargo.toml`, commit, then
  `git tag v0.2.0 && git push --tags`. The same workflow starts
  (the tag must match the version in `Cargo.toml`, otherwise it stops).
- *Test only*: *Run workflow* leaving the version field **empty**. It builds everything
  and leaves the files in *Artifacts* at the bottom of the page, publishing nothing.

### Files produced (do not rename them: automatic updates look for these names)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `grabbit-windows-x86_64.exe` | Windows |
| `grabbit-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | Linux Intel/AMD |
| `grabbit-linux-aarch64.AppImage` | Linux ARM (only if the repository is public) |
| `Grabbit-macos-aarch64.app.zip` / `Grabbit-macos-x86_64.app.zip` | macOS, first installation |
| `grabbit-macos-aarch64` / `grabbit-macos-x86_64` | macOS, used by automatic updates |

### If something goes wrong

- **"Permission denied" or "protected branch"** in the *prepare* step: the permissions in
  step 3 of the preparation are missing, or the `main` branch is protected and does not accept
  commits from the workflow. In that case raise the version by hand and use the tag method.
- **"Process completed with exit code 126"**: a script file lost its execute permission
  during upload (zip/Windows). The workflow already runs scripts with `bash`,
  so using the latest version of the files is enough.
- **"Node.js 20 is deprecated" warnings**: they are just GitHub warnings, not errors.
- **A build fails**: open the red job and read the error (usually in the last lines),
  then fix the code. The release is never published halfway: it only goes out if Windows,
  Linux and macOS all succeed. After the fix, run again with a new version
  (if the workflow already created the tag, delete it from *Code → Tags* or use the next number).
- The **CI** workflow runs on every push and checks formatting, warnings and tests on
  all three systems, so errors show up before the release.

## Building locally on Windows

With Rust installed (<https://rustup.rs>) double-click `packaging\windows\build.bat`:
it creates `grabbit-windows-x86_64.exe`.

## Building from source

```bash
cargo run --release                      # run
cargo test                               # unit tests
packaging/linux/build-appimage.sh        # create the AppImage (Linux)
python3 scripts/make_icon.py             # regenerate the icons (needs Pillow)
```

Requires Rust 1.85+. On Linux no special development libraries are needed.

Tests against a real yt-dlp (optional):

```bash
GRABBIT_YTDLP=/path/to/yt-dlp cargo test -- --ignored
```

To force the interface language (for testing): `GRABBIT_LANG=it` or `GRABBIT_LANG=en`.

## Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/app.rs` | graphical interface (egui) |
| `src/downloader.rs` | builds the yt-dlp commands, reads progress, cancels |
| `src/tools.rs` | downloads/updates yt-dlp, Deno, ffmpeg |
| `src/spotify.rs` | reads title/artist from Spotify links |
| `src/selfupdate.rs` | automatic app updates |
| `src/config.rs` | saved settings |
| `src/i18n.rs` | interface language (Italian / English) |

## Common problems

- **Automatic update does not start**: read the status line at the bottom of the window.
  It says whether Grabbit is already up to date, whether there is no release (or the repository
  is private: the app cannot read it, a public repository is needed), whether GitHub rate-limited
  the requests, or whether the release does not contain the file for your system. The *Check for
  Grabbit updates* button in the advanced options repeats the check immediately. After an
  update the app restarts once and does not update again in that run, to avoid loops.
- **"Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" / restricted videos**: in
  *Advanced options* choose the browser to take cookies from.
- **macOS**: ffmpeg is downloaded as the Intel version (it runs through Rosetta on Apple
  Silicon); if you have Homebrew (`brew install ffmpeg`) that one is used instead.
- **Linux without AppImage** (binary started by hand): it works, but the app cannot
  replace itself; it only shows the link to the new release.
